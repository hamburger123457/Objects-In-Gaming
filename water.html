        <h3 class="blue_text">But what significance does it hold from a game design perspective?</h2>
        <p class="blue_text">We need water in order to live. It's as simple as that right?</p>
        <h1 id="no">No</h1>
        <p class="water_paragraph">To an extent, we do need water to survive. But not in the way you think. Every day, an estimated seven million people die to bad water design in video games. But wait, there's more. Of those seven million people, over twenty billion of them actually never played the game. This is due to an effect called "bad water design in video games causing death because of how bad it is", or BWDIVGCDBOHBII. This has incredibly bad symptoms, namely death, and the fact that you died due to lazy game companies. But what if there was a better way out? Well, keep thinking, because there isn't. Water is everything in video games, and is the main determining factor of the quality of a game, and is so everything about the game, from gameplay to difficulty, to aesthetics, to performance, to realism, to engagement, even to marketing. Water in video games, just like in real life, must be heavily desalinated and removed of all bacteria before it is safe for human consumption. But after the salt is removed, water can work perfectly with other elements of the game. Water is the one miscellaneous object that works with every other miscellaneous object in perfect miscellaneous harmony. But how well do games work with the miscellaneous object universally known as water, containing one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms, which has a freezing point of zero degrees celsius and a boiling point of one hundred degrees celsius? Let's find out.</p>

            <h1 class="center">Water in Minecraft</h1>
            <p>Water in Minecraft isn't all it's hyped up to be. Actually, maybe not I'm kind of writing this one step at a time. Anyway, water in Minecraft is alright. It has unique characters that spawn in it, providing enough incentive to go to it. You can also use it to hydrate crops, which is optional, but you can find water nearly everywhere, which ruins its novelty. It doesn't make sense that you can find rivers running through plains. For a game that is prized for its realism, that doesn't make much sense. Also, water does not serve much use besides crop farming. The way lighting is applied to water could be done much better, as no sane body of water would be fully transparent.</p>

            <p>Water in Terraria varies given the circumstances, like the colour, and the creatures that can spawn in it. Many different objects can either interact or are made from water. Water physics work well in Terraria, leveling and flowing down very smoothly. Water also interacts with lava and honey blocks to create obsidian and honey respectfully. I have no problems with this water at all.</p>

            <h1 class="center">Water in the Pokemon Series</h1>
            <p>Water has had a major role in the Pokemon Series right from the get-go. It's always been a part of basically every game, with things being added across time, such as fishing, diving, surfing so on and so forth. The bodies of water are often very detailed and generally have a story behind them. Each lake or ocean generally has a slew of unique Pokemon in it, making the player want to go to every place in search of elusive Pokemon.</p>

            <h1 class="center">Water in Prison Architect</h1>
            <p>Water, added in the "Island Bound" DLC, is used to add aesthetic appeal, difficulty, and alternate ways of doing things normally constrained to certain ways. In short, it doesn't really do anything. Sure, while it does add to the realism, there is no reason for water to even exist. Sure, it's a prison. But why would a prison be built near water? It doesn't make sense. Sure it's a prison built on an island. But why an island? Why even buy the game at this point if all you get for your optional side content is an ineffective wall?</p>

            <h1 class="center">Water in the Yo-Kai Watch Series</h1>
            <p>At a first glance at Yo-kai Watch, water seems to be only used for aesthetic purposes and serves no functionality. It does this reasonably well, being in areas where you would expect to find water, such as a lake on a mountain(?). After analyzing this game further, however, there is a lot more to water than just a good-looking barrier (though that is important). Yo-Kai can be found when searching along the water's edge, as well as unique fish. These both vary in between areas, acting as optional side content that rewards the player nicely for inspecting different areas. Nearly every body of water also has a quest or story element attached, giving the player a personal connection to every nook and cranny in the sewer system.</p>

            <h1 class="center">Water in Sea of Thieves</h1>
            <p>In a game about water, you'd expect water to be the prime element of the game containing everything needed for a perfect, desalinated cup of miscellaneous water? Sea of Thieves delivers in every way. The water looks amazing, with waves so realistic numerous people have been washed up on the shore. In areas like lakes, the player can see fish on the surface, showing the attention to detail that has been put into this game's very H2O. From a gameplay perspective, the water covers all neccessary ground. The physics are realistic, it ties in well with the boats the players are given, and the swim speed is reasonable as to both encourage boarding other player's ships but not making it completely easy. Several events are also linked to this water, such as a small shark or a fleet of ships piloted by skeletons ready to send you back to the title screen</p>
