        <h3 class="dark_green_text">But what significance do they hold from a game design perspective?</h2>
        <p class="tree_paragraph">For one, tree's can provide major aesthetic appeal when done right. Trees in an areas of a game can signify life, and dead trees a lack of said life. But it's not just the asthetic appeal that's important. Trees often hold a major role in relation to the core gameplay of games, such as a hiding point of treasure or maybe an adversary, a place to gather resources, or even a landmark in an otherwise featureless landscape. Trees not only add to a realism factor of a game, but they are also a major point of nearly every game.</p>

            <h2 class="center">Trees in Minecraft</h2>
            <p>Trees in Minecraft are interesting. For one, they are an absolutely integral part of the game and perform their role beautifully. They fit with the theme, there are many different types and they are very similar to real life while still fitting in with the game. But they also have a glaring issue that is not intially prevalent to the player. Despite all their usefulness, you don't actually have to use them. All tree products can be obtained without actually interacting with trees, except for bees, but those don't count. This is a major oversight, making a signature icon of Minecraft nothing more than optional side content. Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to enjoy trees in Minecraft, but because of this, I just can't. Why would I spend 2 seconds cutting down a tree when I can spend hours searching villages for some planks?</p>

            <h2 class="center">Trees in Terarria</h2>
            <p>Trees in Terraria are interesting. There are tons of varieties, tons of uses for them and lots of drops of them, but not many core elements are really linked to them. As a side object though, they work really well. Terraria provides an incentive to cut down trees because of numerous rare drops like a sugar glider pet and different types of fruits. Trees are generally in the background of the world, with barely any focus put on them, making them unintrusive yet quite easy to spot. Nearly all areas have an abundance of them, but different types, making them both consistent and varying. The wood trees provide is one of the only materials useable for houses for NPCs (non-player characters). These NPCs provide many advantages to the player. such as help in fights and the ability to purchase items.</p>

            <p>Terraria tree types include: Forest, Corrupt, Crimson, Willow, Jungle, Bamboo, Boreal, Palm, Vanity/Sakura, Hallowed, Giant Glowing Mushroom and Gem </p>

            <h2 class="center">Trees in the Pokemon Series</h2>
            <p>Trees in Pokemon are great from an aesthetic point of view. They include many fine details and offer a lot of variety. There is a lot of trees with relevance to the plot and quests of pokemon, and trees can also offer functionality to the game via being a source of berries, rare pokemon, and more. However, just like Minecraft these trees are completely avoidable and offer next to nothing that cannot be obtained via other means.</p>

            <h2 class="center">Trees in Prison Architect</h2>
            <p>Trees in Prison Architect provide greenery to an otherwise grey (from an enviromnent but also literal point of view). They are generally an annoyance when starting out, as they must be removed before building any structures there. They provide wood when removed, providing a small bonus for your hardship of right clicking once and left clicking twice. Trees can later be self-manufactured in a Forestry, providing a not-so-steady supply of wood for exports and to be used in the prison workshop. These trees suffer the same problem as Minecraft and the Pokemon Series though. They are completely optional to the gameplay UNLESS certain mutators are turned on, which can make trees unable to be removed and/or spread rapidly, forcing you to consider them when building your prison.</p>

            <h2 class="center">Trees in the Yo-kai Watch Series</h2>
            <p>Trees in the Yo-Kai Watch series are some of the best in video gaming history. They provide a perfect mix of optional and essential gameplay elements, being used in the tutorial of the game to teach the player how to both catch bugs and find the various "Yo-Kai" that frequent the area in which the game is based. These trees also look amazing aesthetically, having some of the best graphics the 3ds has to offer. A tree is also used as a catalyst for many of the main events of the game, showing that an older console does not mean the trees will be worse.</p>

            <h2 class="center">Trees in Sea of Thieves</h2>
            <p>There's no other way to say it, trees in Sea of Thieves suck. The only thing they have going for them is amazing aesthetics, but not ones that stand out given the game engine. They don't offer anything at all to the gameplay, they can't be interacted with, and the only use they have is to make an island feel more alive.</p>
