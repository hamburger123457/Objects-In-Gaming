        <p class="center larger_text">After decades of delibiration, the best game has been decided. The Yo-kai Watch Series. It has overexelled in trees, water and buildings which are the only factors in game design that matter. I hope you have enjoyed my website, and thank you for reading my long rants about factors of video game design which matter more than most people think and are often overlooked but really do matter. After all, how are you meant to enjoy a game if all miscellaneous objects provide no extra worth to the game and the only reason you play said game is because of so called 'gameplay elements' or 'fun'. Personally, I believe these myths are exactly, myths. The only thing that matters is the objects, and if it took you ten minutes of reading to realize that, I'm glad that I've done something of such a magnitude in my life. However, if you don't realize the undeniable truth, I laugh at you. How ignorant must you be not to realise the reality of the truth, that objects are the only thing that matter in life.</p>
