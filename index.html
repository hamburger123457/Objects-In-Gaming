        <h2>Purpose of The Site</h3>
        <p>Do you ever play your favourite game and think; This tree covers all criteria for an integral part of a game both from an aesthetic standpoint and a functionality standpoint and I wonder how it compares to other video games? And while it does seem like a solid tree, does it really hold up with it's competitor's in today's highly competitive games industry? In fact, is it really a tree at all, or just a lazy sprite placed by lazy developers to fill a quota that only guarantees their next paycheck and they really don't have motivation to create good games because their overworked and don't get paid enough and when they were little they only wanted to actually play the games and never actually make them, but now they're working the 9-5 with no hope of ever getting out. Oh sorry, I was getting off-topic there. Anyway, it's not just tree's that suffer this problem. Buildings, grass, particles, water, doors, windows, clouds, balls, puddles, raindrops, chairs, tables, food, lips, chargers, cases, ovals, roofs, floors, bins, carpets, air purifiers, laptops, hamburgers, signs, hamburgers, twice, hamburgers, pencils, hamburgers, toilets, hamburgers, hamburgers, hamburgers and cheeseburgers in games all suffer from the endless video game monopoly that draws everything in and never ends that provides nothing more than a few hours of enjoyment for all one's money-oh sorry, did I get off-topic again? Anyway... I aim to show the TRUE quality of games through an unbiased, unprejudiced, factually correct and completely right point of view. The six games (see above) will have their miscellaneous objects judged on what matters most:. With that in mind, the game with the highest overall ranking WILL be the best game with no further dispute on this matter. Enjoy.</p>
